## Summary
The inspiration to build this site came from a lack of proper online websites for Singaporean creatives to truly showcase their work. 
There is also heavy inspiration from **MySpace of the early 2000s**, where a user can edit their own CSS and HTML on their personal pages. 
Similarly, when a user signs up, they're given the option to style their profile page to their heart's content using CSS, by just inputting them into the "Styles" field of the "edit-profile" page.

## Technologies used within the front-end include:
1) React JS
2) Tailwind CSS
3) Auth0
4) Firebase
5) axios
6) React-router-dom
7) socket.io-client
8) daisyUI
9) Vite

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to test the limits of our understanding in building a full stack, single-page-application with an Express JS backend. You can explore the backend repo [here](https://github.com/Chxshire22/The-Gallery-Backend 'backend repo')
